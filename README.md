# code-refactor
My first homework assignment this is the first readme along with my first homeowrk assingment.

I started out this project by going over the code and replacing all the
tags with semantic tags were it was appropriate. I also went over the code and noticed the images needed alt attiributes to decribe the images on the page. I went over the code and made sure all atributes have fallen in seqeuncial order. I re-named the classes in the css style to appropriate names in html. I posted the website live to my repository called code-refactor
